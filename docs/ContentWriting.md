# Your Content Isn't Converting? Here's why
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/POnPkjjT6Pw

00:00:00.160 The problem is most of us will make
00:00:01.760 content with no strategy. We just make
00:00:05.120 spray and prey. Most of you guys are
00:00:07.359 guilty of that. So you don't know what
00:00:08.559 their pain points or challenges are.
00:00:09.920 You're making content that might be
00:00:12.000 valuable to someone, but it's not with a
00:00:14.719 good strategy. So today, I'm going to
00:00:16.400 try to do that trifecta or at least hit
00:00:18.800 that thing where you can create content
00:00:20.560 that's aligned with what you do that
00:00:21.760 establishes your expertise and also
00:00:24.080 creates opportunities for you. So, I'm
00:00:25.760 going to show you the road map on my
00:00:28.240 content to clients blueprint.
00:00:32.479 This is your ideal client profile, your
00:00:34.239 ICP. We struggled mightily through two
00:00:36.640 sessions to come up with your ICP.
00:00:39.280 Assuming you know how to do that. If you
00:00:41.120 don't, just ask Chatbt how to create an
00:00:43.200 ICP and then ask it to ask you
00:00:45.760 questions. Yes. And then fill it out and
00:00:47.520 see if it comes up with something good.
00:00:49.120 Okay. So what we want to do is we want
00:00:50.879 to make a bunch of pieces of content
00:00:52.719 that every once in a while creates
00:00:55.280 interest or agitates a problem. So
00:00:56.960 there's a call to action. So here's how
00:00:59.359 we would do something like this. You
00:01:00.879 know, take a diagnostic quiz. Find out
00:01:03.600 what's really holding your business
00:01:05.280 back. So for him it would be find out
00:01:07.280 what's really holding your your growth
00:01:09.680 on Instagram back cuz his profile wants
00:01:12.560 to grow on Instagram or why your
00:01:15.439 Facebook ads are failing.
00:01:18.000 Right? As soon as you hear that, you're
00:01:19.280 like, &quot;Wow, I'm going to learn
00:01:20.640 something.&quot; So, these are just sample
00:01:22.799 versions of a quiz that you can ask them
00:01:25.119 to take. The reason why we ask people to
00:01:27.040 take a quiz is because not everyone who
00:01:28.960 consumes our content is qualified as
00:01:31.439 needing our services. And what we have
00:01:33.360 to do is we have to separate the
00:01:35.600 potential people versus just general
00:01:37.520 interest. Even if you have a,000 or
00:01:39.520 2,000 followers on Instagram, we know
00:01:42.079 not 100% of those 2,000 followers are
00:01:44.400 potential buyers of your stuff. Nothing
00:01:46.079 wrong with that. Love you for following
00:01:47.360 me. love you for engaging, but you're
00:01:49.200 not my customer. And that's totally
00:01:50.479 cool. When I do something, I want it to
00:01:53.040 be for my customer. Okay? Because
00:01:55.200 they're going to buy or not. So, another
00:01:57.200 form of a diagnostic quiz is discover
00:01:59.439 your biggest growth blocker about
00:02:01.520 whatever and how to fix it. So, who here
00:02:03.920 has a growth blocker? What do you do?
00:02:05.920 >> I do product design, but specifically in
00:02:08.239 design systems.
00:02:10.239 >> Oh, that sounds so complicated. Make it
00:02:12.800 simple for a fifth grader like myself to
00:02:14.319 understand. Um, I try to make it easy
00:02:16.640 for companies to understand what color
00:02:18.800 palettes to use, the typography, fonts
00:02:21.520 to use without it being so scattered
00:02:24.160 across their website.
00:02:25.760 >> If I were to make a piece of content to
00:02:27.520 attract you, what would this headline
00:02:29.520 have to read? Discover your biggest
00:02:30.959 growth blocker to what?
00:02:32.560 >> Scale your business within the website
00:02:35.040 that you make it more visually
00:02:37.040 attractive.
00:02:37.760 >> No, no, no. If I'm not trying to attract
00:02:39.519 you as a coach, what would I have to say
00:02:42.160 to you for you? like Chris, get me in
00:02:43.599 your program right now.
00:02:44.480 >> Getting your audience to look at your
00:02:47.200 profile as much as you can.
00:02:49.040 >> Okay, that's not bad. They can use
00:02:51.120 stronger language. Yeah. So, if I were
00:02:53.440 what's your name, Chantel? If I was
00:02:54.640 trying to attract Chantel into my
00:02:56.480 program, which I don't have one, I would
00:02:58.400 say discover your biggest growth blocker
00:03:00.879 attracting the dream advertising clients
00:03:02.640 or something like that. And you're like,
00:03:04.720 what? And how to fix it. M.
00:03:07.200 >> So the more specific I can get the
00:03:08.720 language where you say you say that's
00:03:10.720 me, it works. Everybody understand that?
00:03:13.360 So here's another example. Take this
00:03:15.040 60-cond assessment to see what stage
00:03:16.800 you're in and what to do next. So all
00:03:19.519 businesses are in different stages.
00:03:21.200 Maybe you're kind of early freelance or
00:03:23.200 you're like late stage freelance or
00:03:24.800 you're an entrepreneur or something. We
00:03:26.400 would take we would create that for you.
00:03:28.080 Yeah. So people love taking diagnostic
00:03:30.879 quizzes because it's all about you. I
00:03:33.840 mean anybody take the MyersBrigg test?
00:03:36.159 Basically, it takes like 30 minutes. At
00:03:38.480 some point, it becomes really painful.
00:03:39.680 Like, god dang it, how many ways you
00:03:41.200 want to ask me if I don't like people or
00:03:42.560 not? I do not like people. Stay away
00:03:43.840 from people. Clearly, I'm an eye. Yes.
00:03:46.640 Okay. So, we love taking those kinds of
00:03:48.480 quizzes. Especially if the result is
00:03:51.040 illuminating to us. Okay. So, what you
00:03:53.440 do is you make content that says, &quot;Would
00:03:56.080 you like to find out what's really
00:03:58.000 holding your business back? Take this
00:03:59.439 quiz.&quot; Okay? And in the quiz, it's going
00:04:02.879 to give them an assessment, but it's
00:04:04.799 also going to help you figure out, are
00:04:07.599 they good for you or not? So, the quiz
00:04:09.760 is a filter. Everybody understand the
00:04:11.760 concept? This is like the uh Goldilocks
00:04:14.480 and the three bears. Is it Goldilocks?
00:04:16.320 Yes. Is it Gold? Oh, yeah. The porridge
00:04:18.478 is too hot. It's too cold. And just
00:04:19.918 right. So, too hot, too cold. Well, so
00:04:23.520 hot is Yes. Right. Perfect. Let's get on
00:04:27.759 a call. Jump on a webinar. I want you to
00:04:30.240 invite you to this other program. So
00:04:32.080 that's how you separate them. The nos
00:04:34.000 are really straightforward. You can't
00:04:35.919 afford me. What you want I can't deliver
00:04:38.320 and your timeline is too long. Let's
00:04:39.919 just say whatever whatever the criteria
00:04:41.520 is. Then you send them a resource and
00:04:43.919 the resource is what to do so that
00:04:46.160 eventually you can become a yes. That
00:04:48.960 makes sense. Yes. So if they're stuck on
00:04:51.120 like business basics and you teach
00:04:53.040 advanced strategies, we'll teach them
00:04:55.280 the business basics. The key here is
00:04:57.520 this is repeatable, scalable infinitely.
00:04:59.680 So, it's got to be a digital thing. It
00:05:01.600 could be a Loom recording. It could be a
00:05:04.080 PDF. It could be a template, a resource,
00:05:06.479 something that they would find to be
00:05:07.840 valuable that would then get them back
00:05:09.840 into the cycle when they take the test
00:05:11.759 again in 3, six, nine months. They're
00:05:13.680 like, &quot;Wow, I'm I'm moving to maybe now
00:05:16.000 from a no to maybe.&quot; Okay, the may are a
00:05:19.039 little tricky. The may in sales waste
00:05:21.759 all your time. So, what we want to do
00:05:24.560 instead of jumping on a call with all
00:05:26.160 the may is to send them probably a
00:05:29.600 multi-day email sequence to slowly
00:05:32.479 nurture them or a multi-week or
00:05:34.240 multimonth sequence. All right? So, what
00:05:37.039 you can do is you can teach them a small
00:05:38.560 lesson across time and say, &quot;We're not a
00:05:40.560 perfect fit yet.
00:05:43.039 Here's what we we're going to do.&quot; Okay?
00:05:44.960 I'm going to give you some resources
00:05:46.560 over time. So, then the nos become may
00:05:50.639 become yes. So no normally is no.
00:05:53.919 Remember this is scalable needs to be
00:05:55.840 scalable. That's a critical component to
00:05:57.680 this. So it's usually digital almost
00:06:00.240 always. So that eventually in 3 to 6
00:06:03.199 months they become may and may over time
00:06:07.919 some interval
00:06:09.919 we're slowly building relationship with
00:06:11.759 them. Okay. The obvious thing that
00:06:14.639 you're probably thinking is do nos
00:06:17.120 always become may? No. There's a reason
00:06:19.440 why they're no. They're just dead end.
00:06:20.720 They're stuck. They'll never get out of
00:06:22.000 their own way. We know people like this.
00:06:23.440 Some of them are related to us. Okay? We
00:06:26.479 move some of them to the may. And then
00:06:28.800 some of the may become yeses. You follow
00:06:32.000 so far? Okay. So, what we want to do is
00:06:34.639 we want to create content that gets your
00:06:36.720 potential buyer to say, &quot;That's me.
00:06:39.120 You're speaking my language. You're
00:06:41.199 pointing out the things that I would
00:06:42.639 think.&quot; Okay? This is a critical part.
00:06:44.639 So, the test is always if they say,
00:06:46.880 &quot;That's me.&quot; Okay? Now, I want you all
00:06:49.759 to do this. Travel in your mind for a
00:06:51.840 second to the last three to five posts
00:06:54.000 you've done. Be honest with yourself
00:06:56.319 here. Have you ever once created a piece
00:06:58.720 of content where that would elicit a
00:07:01.120 that's me from your core buyer, from
00:07:03.199 your core audience? Let's Let's be
00:07:05.360 honest. Cuz if you see yes, I'm going to
00:07:07.199 look at your feed. You have?
00:07:08.720 >> Yeah.
00:07:09.360 >> Show me.
00:07:10.720 >> I just posted it.
00:07:12.080 >> Well, pull it up.
00:07:13.360 >> Okay.
00:07:13.680 >> I've always been a slashy. I just didn't
00:07:15.440 have a word for it. So instead of trying
00:07:17.440 to niche down or focus on one thing, I
00:07:19.199 leaned into my slashiness. And my mom
00:07:21.520 still doesn't know how to explain what I
00:07:22.960 do, but that's okay. And then it tells
00:07:24.560 you to go to Adobe Max to watch my talk.
00:07:27.370 [laughter]
00:07:28.400 >> Is there anybody here slashy? Uniform
00:07:30.800 Zoolander actor, model slash.
00:07:34.800 >> My my joke to that is if you're a
00:07:36.479 slasher, you're a serial killer.
00:07:39.120 >> I mean, yes. I I'm slashing your way.
00:07:42.080 Okay, cool. All right. I want you to
00:07:44.160 describe their stuck moment.
00:07:46.639 When are they stuck? So the example here
00:07:48.960 is it's 11 p.m. and they're rewriting
00:07:51.680 the same email. That's their stuck
00:07:54.080 moment, right? Okay. So describe their
00:07:57.199 stuck moment.
00:07:58.000 >> Like they have multiple things that
00:07:59.440 they're always doing and they don't know
00:08:00.879 how to make a career or
00:08:03.840 life with all of those skills.
00:08:06.560 >> Okay. Is that what they're saying in
00:08:08.000 their head?
00:08:08.639 >> Yeah. I mean, that's what I think.
00:08:10.160 That's what I said to myself.
00:08:11.520 >> Well, who's a slasher over here? You're
00:08:12.960 a slasher. When do you experience that
00:08:14.960 same stuck moment?
00:08:15.840 >> I mean, in all honesty, in those
00:08:17.199 moments, I think I'm like, maybe I
00:08:19.280 should just give up everything and just
00:08:20.720 start from scratch.
00:08:21.599 >> Maybe give up. Start over. Okay. What
00:08:24.800 else? Anything else? Any other slashers
00:08:27.120 in here?
00:08:27.759 >> What I would say out loud was, &quot;Damn,
00:08:30.479 you're talented now. Just need to find
00:08:33.200 someone to pay you for one of those
00:08:35.120 talents.&quot;
00:08:35.519 >> Perfect. Stop there. I'm talented. Just
00:08:37.360 need someone to pay me. What we're
00:08:38.880 trying to do is there's a bunch of
00:08:39.919 prompts here. We're trying to find each
00:08:41.679 person in a stuck moment. Here's some
00:08:43.360 things that they say. We got that part.
00:08:45.040 Okay. So, their stuck moment, what they
00:08:47.519 say out loud, what they think privately
00:08:49.920 is, maybe I'm not good enough. Maybe I
00:08:52.080 want to give up. We can expand on that.
00:08:54.000 What other things might they say?
00:08:55.360 >> Uh, maybe I should go back to school.
00:08:57.440 >> Perfect. Go back to school. I'm smart.
00:08:59.440 I'll think this through. There's some
00:09:00.720 paralysis going on there. The world's
00:09:02.880 not fair.
00:09:04.800 Okay, fine. What do they think the
00:09:06.720 problem is that's wrong?
00:09:08.560 >> There's not enough jobs.
00:09:09.920 >> That's a good one. What else? People
00:09:12.080 don't get it. That's a good one. She
00:09:14.160 said people don't get it. That's a good
00:09:15.600 one. Yeah.
00:09:16.640 >> The market is too saturated.
00:09:18.959 >> Market is saturated.
00:09:20.800 >> AI would take my job at some point.
00:09:22.720 >> That's such a good one. That is so
00:09:24.560 relevant right now.
00:09:25.440 >> Okay. AI will take my job.
00:09:27.200 >> Overthinking.
00:09:28.000 >> Taking action. Making a decision. Let me
00:09:29.760 just quickly recap everybody. What we're
00:09:31.519 trying to do is create content that
00:09:33.680 highlights a problem in the voice and
00:09:35.600 attitude and opinions of the people
00:09:37.040 we're trying to attract such that by
00:09:39.680 consuming some of the content, they say
00:09:41.920 to themselves out loud or in their own
00:09:43.440 minds, that's me. I feel so seen right
00:09:46.399 now. If you can do that, you can move
00:09:49.279 them towards the solution. Okay? So, the
00:09:51.279 example here on the paper is it's 11
00:09:54.320 o'clock at night and they're rewriting
00:09:56.160 the same email and they say to
00:09:57.920 themselves, &quot;I've tried everything.&quot; and
00:09:59.600 they think to themselves, I'm not good
00:10:01.519 enough. Maybe I'm not good enough.
00:10:02.880 Right? And they say to themselves, I
00:10:04.800 just need more followers.
00:10:07.360 What the real problem is, they don't
00:10:08.959 know how to communicate their value. The
00:10:11.440 emotion behind is frustration leading to
00:10:13.839 self-doubt.
00:10:15.360 Follow so far. If it continues, they
00:10:17.839 burn out.
00:10:19.920 Wish what they wish someone told them is
00:10:22.240 you're not crazy. It's just your
00:10:24.560 strategy that's off. So, the real
00:10:26.560 problem is they're not taking action.
00:10:27.760 They're not being decisive. What else is
00:10:29.440 the problem? They are a generalist.
00:10:32.560 Isn't the solution to be a specialist?
00:10:35.360 That would be my answer. And I can argue
00:10:37.279 for all that all day long,
00:10:38.959 >> but maybe you and the slashies have a
00:10:40.800 different point of view. The real
00:10:42.160 problem is find your one thing as a
00:10:44.160 generalist trying to get opportunity.
00:10:46.640 What is your feeling?
00:10:48.399 >> Um, I think the feeling maybe is
00:10:51.200 confusion.
00:10:52.240 >> Conf. You feel confused. Is there a
00:10:54.320 stronger emotion?
00:10:55.440 >> Yeah. I guess like this sounds so
00:10:57.519 dramatic, but like I guess some level of
00:10:59.440 despair.
00:11:00.240 >> Despair. That's a good word. Do you feel
00:11:02.399 bitter?
00:11:02.959 >> Uh, I wouldn't say bitter.
00:11:04.240 >> Okay, not yet. You're so young.
00:11:05.920 >> There's [laughter] time.
00:11:10.160 >> Sorry. I take shots every time I can get
00:11:12.399 them. How's your Anything else?
00:11:13.839 >> I think it's going to be a lot of the
00:11:15.279 same types of words like you. Hopeless.
00:11:16.959 >> Hopeless.
00:11:17.839 >> Okay, perfect. If it continues this way,
00:11:20.640 nothing changes. What happens? I guess
00:11:22.480 you either stay like in my mind I'm like
00:11:24.560 I stay at this job that I don't like and
00:11:26.560 I'm unfulfilled.
00:11:27.839 >> What's the more extreme? Keep going down
00:11:29.279 the logic. The
00:11:29.920 >> topic. Okay. Okay. I'm unfulfilled and
00:11:31.600 then I get so bitter that I start hating
00:11:33.680 design.
00:11:34.240 >> There you go. You hate what you used to
00:11:36.000 love.
00:11:36.720 >> Yes.
00:11:37.519 >> You might become bitter.
00:11:39.040 >> Maybe at that point before hate is
00:11:41.360 bitterness. I believe maybe there's some
00:11:43.760 anger in there and you might you might
00:11:45.600 start phoning it in at work.
00:11:47.519 >> True. Some of your content could be,
00:11:51.279 have you lost the passion for what you
00:11:53.600 do and you're starting to phone it in?
00:11:56.480 Take this quiz to find out if you're,
00:11:58.000 you know, something like that. Yes. So
00:12:00.160 now the content is going to ring with
00:12:01.920 all the slashies out there.
00:12:04.800 All the all the specialists are just
00:12:06.320 counting their money anyways. They're
00:12:07.519 like, &quot;This is not for me.&quot; All right.
00:12:10.720 So now comes the truth. This is where
00:12:14.480 the rubber meets the road. what they
00:12:17.120 wish someone told them. This is the
00:12:18.639 knowledge, the expertise that you have.
00:12:20.399 I think if you just package all of your
00:12:22.399 greatness into something easier for
00:12:23.920 people to understand, you have better
00:12:25.519 opportunities.
00:12:26.720 >> How do you feel about that?
00:12:27.680 >> That resonates with me. Yeah.
00:12:28.959 >> See the way she said that she didn't go
00:12:30.240 high pitch on me.
00:12:31.120 >> I mean,
00:12:31.680 >> she went lower register.
00:12:32.880 >> You know, it's real hard to do this like
00:12:34.720 real quick.
00:12:35.680 >> It it is [laughter] even when it's not
00:12:37.440 your thing. So, we're not going to ask
00:12:38.800 her to change. We're just going to
00:12:40.000 package it differently. I think she can
00:12:42.000 hear that.
00:12:42.959 >> So, that's great.
00:12:43.920 >> It's not this. It's the packaging. It's
00:12:45.760 not you, it's the packaging
00:12:49.600 or positioning or something like that.
00:12:52.160 And that's what I have a sevenstep
00:12:53.760 program to teach you how to package
00:12:55.279 yourself so you are they're chasing you
00:12:58.240 down. And that's really what everybody
00:13:00.000 wants. We want to be understood,
00:13:01.920 appreciated, and a plan to get us out
00:13:03.920 from A to B. So, there's just a little A
00:13:06.240 to B in here, and we're good. Okay. Now,
00:13:09.519 you know what the irony of it is? I
00:13:11.440 didn't mean to trick you. I just do it
00:13:13.600 all the time naturally.
00:13:15.519 The solution is for you to pretend to be
00:13:17.440 a specialist. So all of you slashies,
00:13:19.839 there's nothing wrong with you. You just
00:13:21.760 have to pretend to be a specialist.
00:13:23.600 Okay?
00:13:24.000 >> So all you specialists, just keep doing
00:13:25.600 what you're doing. You don't have to
00:13:27.200 pretend at all. So now what you want to
00:13:28.880 do is you want to start writing a
00:13:31.440 powerful empathy based hook.
00:13:34.320 So the way it works, here's the example.
00:13:36.079 You know that moment when
00:13:38.480 you're questioning your life decisions,
00:13:40.160 you're searching for a job. You get
00:13:42.000 stuck writing your profile on LinkedIn.
00:13:43.839 and you don't know what to write cuz you
00:13:45.279 want it to be perfect and this is not
00:13:46.639 perfect. Whatever it is that would then
00:13:49.920 that would lead you or if you've ever
00:13:52.399 experienced this thing that we already
00:13:54.000 know what you feel right or most of my
00:13:57.760 this type of client job seekers who are
00:13:59.839 slashies my fellow slashies think this
00:14:03.040 and then write your line. I want to say
00:14:05.360 this I know it's really weird for me to
00:14:06.639 say this at Adobe Max. This is like a
00:14:08.480 visual audience. Yeah, they make visual
00:14:10.399 tools. An overlooked skill of the 21st
00:14:12.399 century is writing because words shape
00:14:14.800 worlds. So your ability to craft
00:14:17.760 language will determine how people
00:14:20.480 understand you or if they think you
00:14:23.360 understand them. But it also open doors
00:14:26.560 in your mind or closed doors. So
00:14:28.880 language is very very powerful, more
00:14:31.760 powerful than we think. All of your
00:14:33.519 experiences,
00:14:35.199 all your memories are locked away with
00:14:37.360 words.
00:14:38.959 So, it's so weird for me to say this at
00:14:41.199 a visual like Adobe visual conference
00:14:43.040 here, but your words really do matter.
00:14:46.320 That's why I do battle with people about
00:14:47.920 their words.
