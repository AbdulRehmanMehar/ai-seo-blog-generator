00:00:00.080 What successful people do is they spend
00:00:01.760 money to save time.
00:00:04.400 Unsuccessful people spend time to save
00:00:06.560 money. You are all focusing on people
00:00:08.720 who have a lot of free time. That's the
00:00:11.280 problem. Most important business lessons
00:00:12.719 I've learned from my coach. When you hit
00:00:14.160 this level, you think you're at the top
00:00:15.440 of the mountain. You're actually just
00:00:16.560 the bottom of the next mountain. From
00:00:18.160 doing this, I started to learn and
00:00:19.920 figure out how to do brand strategy. And
00:00:21.600 then my price just went through the
00:00:22.880 roof. Most of you don't know how to
00:00:24.640 write or create content or create offers
00:00:26.880 cuz this is blurry. I don't know who I'm
00:00:29.840 talking to. And if you stick with me for
00:00:32.479 the rest of this, not only will I teach
00:00:33.920 you how to make money, you'll do this in
00:00:35.920 the most painless, easy way possible.
00:00:38.640 And if you learn how to do it, you can
00:00:40.000 charge a lot of money, too, for other
00:00:41.280 people.
00:00:44.000 No text
00:00:44.320 I got to tell you something. The reason
00:00:45.680 why I want to start here is learning
00:00:47.280 this process
00:00:49.280 changed the game for me. It really
00:00:51.200 changed the game because we think we're
00:00:53.199 designing for someone, but we're not
00:00:54.719 really doing it for anyone. So the way I
00:00:56.640 like to do customer profiles is to
00:00:59.280 really go deep, understand not just the
00:01:01.440 demographics, which most people stop at,
00:01:03.359 but psychoraphics like the way they
00:01:05.040 think, they feel, their values and
00:01:06.240 belief systems. When you do this the way
00:01:08.720 I'm about to teach you to do it right
00:01:10.159 now, it's going to unlock so many things
00:01:12.240 in your mind about what other services
00:01:14.000 you can provide, how you can communicate
00:01:15.840 to them to relate to them better. And
00:01:18.000 and for me, it was just a creative
00:01:19.920 springboard. From doing this, I started
00:01:22.560 to learn and figure out how to do brand
00:01:24.000 strategy.
00:01:25.439 And that was just everything and then my
00:01:27.439 prices just went through the roof. So
00:01:29.360 would you like to learn how to do this?
00:01:30.640 So what we need to do is try to figure
00:01:32.000 No text
00:01:32.400 out who your best client is. Right? So
00:01:36.320 we're going to build it for this for
00:01:37.759 your best client and then you're going
00:01:39.439 to see all of a sudden things that you
00:01:40.799 can do, the way you can market and speak
00:01:42.159 to them, the way you can brand so you
00:01:43.920 become very attracted to this type of
00:01:45.600 person. Right? So usually what people
00:01:48.720 will do is they'll ask me, "Well, what
00:01:50.720 is my ideal client?" Here's what we do.
00:01:53.360 How many people have clients here? raise
00:01:54.720 your hand cuz there's a lot of in-house
00:01:56.799 people. Okay, so now we know the session
00:01:58.079 has begun because the the entrepreneurs
00:02:00.960 have showed up because I talked to one
00:02:02.799 in-house person after I'm like oh my god
00:02:04.479 it's all in in-house people. All right.
00:02:06.640 So, what I want you to do is think about
00:02:08.160 the last 10 clients or projects you've
00:02:10.000 worked on, which ones gave you the most
00:02:12.000 joy. Like, just think about like, oh my
00:02:14.080 god, if I could just do one more project
00:02:15.760 like that, I'm going to be so h I would
00:02:17.920 paid that person to do the work. That's
00:02:20.160 how happy I was. Number two, was it
00:02:23.360 financially good for you? Did you make
00:02:25.680 money on that? Right? Are you aligned
00:02:28.239 also in their mission? So, creatively
00:02:30.480 really cool, cool people. I made a lot
00:02:32.640 of money. That's a trifecta. So, just
00:02:34.879 scan through your mind the last 10
00:02:36.879 clients or projects you worked on.
00:02:38.879 You're like, "God, if I could just get
00:02:40.160 more of them, life would be so, so
00:02:42.640 good." And you're going to remember this
00:02:44.160 moment because we're going to design it
00:02:45.360 for you. Okay? Remember, they have to
00:02:47.040 have money. Some of you like to target
00:02:49.040 broke people and you're like, "Well,
00:02:50.560 they can't afford me." I'm like, "I
00:02:52.400 wonder why." Cuz they broke is why. So,
00:02:55.280 don't pick someone who's broke. They got
00:02:56.640 to be able to afford you. Actually,
00:02:58.160 afford a lot of you because you want to
00:02:59.760 keep charging more. Yes. So, one thing
00:03:01.840 that we have to do is we have to find
00:03:03.920 someone who's hungry or starving for
00:03:05.760 what it is that we do and would be happy
00:03:07.840 to give us the money so that we can help
00:03:09.760 them. Do you know who the Hermosis are?
00:03:11.519 Alex and Leila Hermoszi.
00:03:14.080 I lost track of how much money they
00:03:15.599 spend for the two of them. They're both
00:03:18.080 entrepreneurs. Since you don't know
00:03:19.280 them, what do you imagine they pay their
00:03:21.120 media teams on a monthly basis? What do
00:03:23.120 you think their monthly budget is? What
00:03:24.560 would you say?
00:03:25.200 You talking about their monthly budget?
00:03:26.640 Yeah, monthly budget for for for both of
00:03:28.879 them.
00:03:29.760 What do you think it is? I'm pretty sure
00:03:30.799 it's a lot higher than what I'm
00:03:31.840 charging.
00:03:32.080 Well, I Who cares about you right now?
00:03:33.440 What do you think they're paying?
00:03:34.560 Um, let's say probably probably up to
00:03:36.720 a,000. I say that.
00:03:37.680 A,000. Okay, good. Does I mean, does
00:03:39.599 anybody here know?
00:03:40.480 200 grand.
00:03:41.280 200 grand. So, between a,000 to 200,000.
00:03:43.599 I saw Alex a couple years ago. He went
00:03:45.599 up on stage and he goes, I spend $50,000
00:03:47.840 a month myself.
00:03:48.879 Okay.
00:03:49.120 And then with my wife, it's 100k. And
00:03:50.640 then I heard there was like a 100k each
00:03:52.080 now. And it's just it keeps going up cuz
00:03:54.000 they've realized something. the more
00:03:55.760 they spend on their content, the bigger
00:03:57.920 their business gets, the bigger the
00:03:59.920 opportunities. And basically, from the
00:04:02.400 content that they generate, they get so
00:04:04.319 many qualified leads, they don't know
00:04:05.680 what to do with themselves. So, you're
00:04:08.319 busy talking to the choreographers of
00:04:10.239 the world when they don't see the value
00:04:12.080 in what you do, right?
00:04:14.319 So, it's like you trying to attract a
00:04:16.160 person that's not attracted to you, it's
00:04:18.720 kind of a dead chase.
00:04:20.000 Sorry, I have a question.
00:04:20.959 Yeah. Do you wait for these clients to
00:04:23.919 find you or do you go chase them?
00:04:26.960 No. No. You design this person and then
00:04:29.520 you become so attracted to this person.
00:04:31.680 I don't know about you. My brother told
00:04:33.280 me this dating advice when I was a
00:04:34.800 little dude. He goes, "You know who is
00:04:36.160 it that you would be most attracted to?
00:04:37.840 Sit down there and write on a piece of
00:04:39.440 paper the ideal person for you." You did
00:04:42.639 that and then you forgot about it. And
00:04:44.639 this is what you do. This is what you
00:04:46.080 do. This is what how we design our ideal
00:04:48.560 partner, business partner, right? All
00:04:51.360 right. So, with your interior designer,
00:04:53.440 same problem. If they were doing four,
00:04:55.199 five, $10 million homes, the interior
00:04:57.440 designer would get so much and then they
00:04:58.880 would hire you. It just works that way.
00:05:01.440 Does everybody understand this concept?
00:05:03.199 So, what's the problem? Why are we just
00:05:04.560 looking for broke clients?
00:05:06.960 Why do we do that to ourselves?
00:05:09.680 Is it like looking in a mirror? I see
00:05:11.520 you.
00:05:13.039 What's happening, guys? Why do we want
00:05:14.800 to work with people who cannot afford to
00:05:16.240 pay us? Okay, so what Gabby is saying,
00:05:19.360 we like to work with people that we feel
00:05:22.000 are aligned with us in terms of taste,
00:05:24.479 creativity, but those same people don't
00:05:26.639 have money. Cuz you know why? Cuz we
00:05:28.240 don't have money. Cuz we're just
00:05:29.360 aligned. We're perfectly aligned. So
00:05:31.039 what are we going to do? Chicken and
00:05:32.160 egg.
00:05:32.560 In addition to that, I like to help
00:05:34.960 small businesses and help them grow so
00:05:38.080 that they can have like the business
00:05:39.440 that they really want.
00:05:40.000 No text
00:05:40.400 I love that. Okay. How you you all are
00:05:43.680 good-natured, creative human beings who
00:05:45.520 want to better the world. Yes, most of
00:05:46.880 you. Some of you just want the money.
00:05:48.240 Talk to me later. Okay, that's fine. So,
00:05:50.479 those of you that want to help people
00:05:51.919 transform their business, what happens
00:05:53.840 when they transform their business? When
00:05:55.280 you take them from 1x to 5x because of
00:05:57.680 some of the contributions you made,
00:05:58.880 clearly they don't run a business. What
00:06:00.560 happens to your relationship?
00:06:02.639 Well, hopefully it keeps going.
00:06:04.160 Do they pay you? Do they pay you 5x more
00:06:06.639 for 5x more years? Has anybody ever had
00:06:09.039 that happen?
00:06:10.960 Oh, see. Okay. You You have for real?
00:06:14.160 All right. Give him the mic cuz I'm
00:06:15.440 going to question you now. All right.
00:06:17.440 I'm a hostile witness. Let's go.
00:06:19.520 I I had a pharmaceutical company
00:06:21.440 startup. It was a startup that
00:06:23.919 um we did a 3D animation for and we did
00:06:26.000 it for Peanuts.
00:06:27.520 What's Peanuts? Let's get real.
00:06:29.199 Uh Peanuts is $3,000.
00:06:31.039 Okay, that's Peanuts. Go on.
00:06:32.240 Yeah.
00:06:32.639 And then they blew up. And so they grew
00:06:35.360 up. Uh we actually grew up and we
00:06:38.080 actually got a little bit disconnected
00:06:40.160 as they were doing some things in house,
00:06:42.240 but as they came back, we were able to
00:06:45.039 bid much bigger projects. 40 grand.
00:06:48.479 Okay.
00:06:48.720 Um 10 grand a month.
00:06:49.919 Okay. That relatively is a lot more. So
00:06:51.680 you're talking about 10x plus.
00:06:53.600 Yeah. Okay. Here's been this has been my
00:06:55.680 experience. You can just hold on the mic
00:06:56.880 for a sec. Okay. My experience has been
00:06:58.560 this. You know, like uh when you're
00:07:00.800 first dating your high school sweetheart
00:07:02.880 and then you guys went to the big city
00:07:04.400 and you went separate ways. All of a
00:07:06.319 sudden she got a big job or he got a big
00:07:08.160 job. You you're not the same to them
00:07:10.000 anymore. They want they they trade up.
00:07:12.720 Most people just trade up. So what'll
00:07:14.479 happen is and this is really sad. Not
00:07:16.319 always true. Like if I was in
00:07:18.240 competition with you and I work at a
00:07:19.759 much higher level when they have the
00:07:21.120 money like we want to work with Chris
00:07:22.319 and his team. They're awardw winning.
00:07:24.000 Look at who they worked with. And most
00:07:25.840 times they just leave you in the dust.
00:07:27.039 And you would do the same. You know how
00:07:28.960 you accepted this low-level intern and
00:07:30.720 then you got real big? They don't have
00:07:32.240 the skills to grow with you. Not
00:07:33.840 everyone is capable of going to the next
00:07:35.520 level. This is what one of the most
00:07:37.280 important business lessons I've learned
00:07:38.560 from my coach. There are tears. You
00:07:40.960 don't know it cuz it's all invisible to
00:07:42.400 you. When you hit this level, you think
00:07:44.080 you're at the top of the mountain.
00:07:45.199 You're actually just the bottom of the
00:07:46.319 next mountain. Okay? So, when we would
00:07:49.039 win $100,000 jobs, we could not win
00:07:50.960 $200,000 jobs. When we win $200,000
00:07:53.360 jobs, I could not win $400,000 jobs
00:07:55.039 because they're very different animals,
00:07:57.199 different levels of competition. And
00:07:58.800 then you get to the million- dollar
00:07:59.840 range, it becomes cutthroat at that
00:08:02.080 level cuz everyone is world class.
00:08:04.800 You've read them in your design books.
00:08:06.720 They're winning all the awards. That's
00:08:07.919 who you're competing with. Now,
00:08:09.199 I have a client uh also my friend.
00:08:13.199 Well, it's not starting strong.
00:08:14.800 Go ahead. Keep going.
00:08:15.680 Uh he runs about six or seven
00:08:17.599 businesses. I'm not sure exactly.
00:08:19.120 Okay. Um I'm estimating he does about 1
00:08:22.400 2 million a year
00:08:23.759 from six to seven businesses.
00:08:25.599 Yeah. Some of them are like passion
00:08:26.879 projects,
00:08:28.000 some of them are
00:08:29.280 he has so he has a coffee uh he roasts
00:08:32.479 coffee, bags it, sells it, distributes
00:08:34.559 it, does all that.
00:08:35.760 Okay.
00:08:36.320 Um that's that's his bread and butter.
00:08:38.240 And then he has construction. Yes. Those
00:08:39.599 are his two bread and butter.
00:08:40.559 Yes. Here's here's the problem with your
00:08:42.000 friend's business. I'm sure he's doing
00:08:43.679 fine. If you just take six and you take
00:08:45.680 1.2, each business on average is about
00:08:47.680 dude 200k. Each one of them is a hobby
00:08:50.000 lifestyle business. I all respect your
00:08:53.040 friend. I don't consider him an
00:08:54.240 entrepreneur. He's doing too many weird
00:08:55.920 things. Why don't you just focus in on
00:08:57.920 the one business is making all the money
00:08:59.440 and just get rid of the other ones?
00:09:01.839 I'll tell him that.
00:09:02.640 Please tell him that and then if it
00:09:04.320 works for him, tell him send me some
00:09:05.760 money. You guys need to I need to change
00:09:06.000 No text
00:09:07.279 your mind. 200K is not a lot of money
00:09:09.600 for your client. You all understand
00:09:12.000 that? 200K because they're only going to
00:09:14.000 spend some percentage of that on you. So
00:09:16.240 now what do you have left? Now, as a
00:09:18.320 rule of thumb, most companies spend
00:09:21.120 about 10% on marketing annually. So,
00:09:24.560 their annual budget for marketing,
00:09:26.080 including people, is 20K. And you're not
00:09:29.120 going to take their whole budget. So,
00:09:30.240 you're going to take a tenth of their
00:09:31.279 budget, which would be 2K. Is that
00:09:33.040 roughly the size of your project? It's
00:09:34.320 about 2K. That's the problem. You see,
00:09:37.600 this is how it works. Just math doesn't
00:09:40.480 doesn't lie. This is it. This is the
00:09:42.399 problem. So, we need somebody here who
00:09:44.399 knows their client, who's doing decent
00:09:46.959 numbers that they would be able to
00:09:48.480 afford people like you, and happy to pay
00:09:50.320 you. Happy to pay you. That's a criteria
00:09:52.720 here for an ideal customer profile.
00:09:55.680 All right.
00:09:56.080 All right. Who's your customer?
00:09:57.519 Um,
00:09:58.080 what do you do first of all?
00:09:59.760 We make beautiful living spaces by
00:10:02.000 selling tile and furniture online.
00:10:04.240 Visual designer. Okay, I got you. Okay.
00:10:06.880 Who's your ideal customer?
00:10:08.640 I would say like one person. Yes. uh
00:10:10.640 like a guy who runs Marriott.
00:10:12.959 Okay. What is his title?
00:10:16.160 He's probably in charge of building de
00:10:18.160 property development. So his title would
00:10:19.839 be like business oper uh business ops or
00:10:22.480 like property developer director or
00:10:24.800 somebody at a high level.
00:10:25.680 Business ops director. Okay. Uh roughly
00:10:27.760 how old are they?
00:10:28.880 45. Okay. Married?
00:10:30.399 They're married.
00:10:31.120 Children?
00:10:31.680 They have at least two kids.
00:10:33.120 Two kids. How old?
00:10:34.959 Uh probably like eight and 14.
00:10:37.360 I like that. So, if you said 36, like
00:10:39.760 the math don't work, right? That's good.
00:10:42.000 Where else might they have a home?
00:10:43.839 Uh, they probably have a a condo up in
00:10:47.120 um New York City.
00:10:49.360 Okay.
00:10:49.760 They probably hang out in Aspen. All the
00:10:51.839 rich people hang out in Aspen, Colorado.
00:10:54.320 That's why I'm not in Aspen. Okay, this
00:10:56.880 is perfect. Uh, what did they study in
00:10:59.120 school?
00:10:59.839 Uh, probably business administration and
00:11:01.600 marketing.
00:11:02.640 This is the easiest part.
00:11:03.839 Yeah, easiest part. Can you guys start
00:11:05.120 to can you sort of envision a
00:11:06.640 45-year-old man who's mar first
00:11:08.480 marriage, second marriage, divorce?
00:11:10.320 What?
00:11:10.560 Um, usually probably it's better if it's
00:11:12.959 his first marriage because then he has
00:11:14.480 better integrity.
00:11:16.240 Okay. Okay. Or can get out of it. That's
00:11:20.160 fine. Okay. First marriage. This is all
00:11:21.839 good. Okay.
00:11:22.240 And stability. More stability, too.
00:11:23.600 So, the next part is a little bit
00:11:24.959 harder. Okay. Now, every step that we do
00:11:27.279 is predicated on the first part being
00:11:28.880 right. So when I do this for clients, I
00:11:31.760 I kind of like do the like little logic
00:11:33.600 check. Does the logic logic? If it
00:11:36.320 doesn't, we got to fix something.
00:11:38.160 There's a logic to you. Okay. How much
00:11:41.200 income does this person make?
00:11:43.040 Uh let's say from the company, he they
00:11:45.519 probably make about between,
00:11:47.760 let's just say, 400,000 plus bonuses.
00:11:50.640 Okay. When you understand the kind of
00:11:53.680 crap they've had to deal with,
00:11:56.079 you hate them a little less.
00:11:57.839 Mhm. So this is why it's really
00:11:59.680 important to build a really good profile
00:12:01.200 because we develop empathy for them. My
00:12:03.600 god, I just walked in the door. I'm a
00:12:05.920 trustworthy person. I would never
00:12:07.519 underpro or overpromise and underdel.
00:12:10.560 But every other person has been in front
00:12:12.480 of Ron
00:12:14.240 has done that to him. Can you
00:12:16.720 understand? So I'm going to be extra
00:12:18.160 sensitive about this so that they
00:12:20.160 understand I'm not here just to get
00:12:21.600 money from you. Most of you don't know
00:12:23.519 how to write or create content or create
00:12:25.440 offers cuz this is blurry.
00:12:28.320 I don't know who I'm talking to. How
00:12:30.240 many times do we have to get each one of
00:12:31.760 you to kneel into one person? Even Greg
00:12:34.639 was trying to change the profile on me.
00:12:36.560 But here's something real interesting.
00:12:37.000 No text
00:12:38.160 When we gave him a name, he started to
00:12:40.160 stick to it. This is the power of being
00:12:42.320 hyperfocused in serving a specific type
00:12:45.440 of client. So, would you rather for the
00:12:48.399 rest of your life chase people who are
00:12:51.040 barely scratching at this or get three
00:12:53.440 or four of these types of clients? you
00:12:55.200 would have more business than you know
00:12:56.639 what to do with. I think we often want
00:12:58.720 to rush into the work as well and not
00:13:00.560 really like dig deep dig deep.
00:13:02.399 Speaking truth
00:13:03.680 because it makes us feel uncomfortable
00:13:05.680 and we know from I guess a lot of
00:13:09.040 practice. Well, at least we do the work,
00:13:11.120 we have something to show for at the end
00:13:12.560 of the day. But when you do a lot of the
00:13:14.079 thinking work, you're like, well, what
00:13:15.040 did I just come up with? But I'll tell
00:13:16.720 you something right now. There's that
00:13:18.720 expression. I will measure a hundred
00:13:20.480 times before I cut one piece of wood.
00:13:23.040 This is the measuring part. You guys are
00:13:25.120 busy chopping down trees. You're killing
00:13:27.040 earth. Yeah, that's what you're doing.
00:13:28.880 You just chop away. You don't know what
00:13:30.160 you're looking for. When I've done this
00:13:31.760 for clients, they have that same
00:13:35.120 expression.
00:13:36.959 I've never felt so seen. I've never felt
00:13:39.279 like I've understood our clients before.
00:13:41.440 How'd you do that? Or they'll say
00:13:43.279 something like, you've done in 30
00:13:44.720 minutes what we've been unable to do in
00:13:46.639 the last year. That's a real statement
00:13:48.480 that somebody has told me. Your value in
00:13:51.519 their mind has gone through the roof.
00:13:53.519 Now, when you see the bill, you'll
00:13:55.040 understand why. Yeah, this I don't know
00:13:58.000 this person, but I know enough people
00:13:59.680 like this that once I get enough
00:14:01.040 information, I can build the rest of the
00:14:02.639 profile. And all of you can do that,
00:14:03.839 too, because you have this beautiful
00:14:05.279 thing. No matter what discipline you're
00:14:07.040 in, you have this thing called
00:14:08.880 imagination.
00:14:10.880 Yeah. Once we have enough, we can
00:14:12.959 project forward.
