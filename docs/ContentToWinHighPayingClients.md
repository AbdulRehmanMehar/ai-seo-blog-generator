00:00:00.160 Your client desires something beyond the
00:00:02.800 thing that you make. But what we almost
00:00:05.279 always do is sell the thing that we
00:00:07.359 make. I make websites. I make shoes. I
00:00:10.320 make whatever it is. And that's why
00:00:12.160 we're not tapping into the highest
00:00:14.160 potential value what we do.
00:00:15.000 No text
00:00:18.000 So every time I ask creative people like
00:00:20.000 who do you serve? They almost always say
00:00:21.920 like startups, early stage founders. And
00:00:25.039 that is code word for me. You know what
00:00:26.560 that code word is for? Broke.
00:00:30.160 Everybody wants to work with broke
00:00:31.519 clients and I Chris, I can't make any
00:00:33.040 money. I wonder why. Why? Why do you
00:00:37.120 always want to work with broke ass
00:00:39.520 clients? I've never dreamt once in my
00:00:42.399 life. I never said, Amy, please help me
00:00:43.840 find a broke client. Help me find an
00:00:45.680 early stage startup. They have no money.
00:00:49.600 There's one area in which startups have
00:00:51.280 money. Do you know where that is?
00:00:54.320 VC. You know, if you help them do a
00:00:57.280 pitch deck, you will get lots of money.
00:00:58.879 I have a friend who does that. She loves
00:01:01.280 startups. She helps companies put
00:01:03.920 together decks so they can get $200
00:01:05.600 million.
00:01:06.320 Oh, we do that.
00:01:07.280 Yeah. Yeah. Who does that? Anybody here?
00:01:10.080 Okay. You You make a lot of money. You
00:01:12.240 have. Okay. You know, you know that's
00:01:13.600 the game, right? How much money you
00:01:14.960 trying to raise? You ask them. What do
00:01:16.960 they say?
00:01:18.720 10 million. All right. Let's Let's do
00:01:20.000 No text
00:01:20.000 this. Watch Steve, right? Okay. I'm
00:01:22.720 horrible with names there, but I I'll
00:01:24.000 keep asking you over and over. Okay.
00:01:25.600 Steve is trying to help a company raise
00:01:27.520 $10 million in capital and then you
00:01:29.600 write the pitch deck, you teach them how
00:01:30.880 to speak, whatever, right? How much do
00:01:32.400 you charge, Steve?
00:01:34.079 Uh, as part of an agency, maybe about
00:01:36.000 5%.
00:01:37.040 How much?
00:01:37.600 Up to 5%.
00:01:38.560 Up to 5%. So, what is 5% of 10 million?
00:01:43.040 500K.
00:01:47.600 That's pretty good. Okay. So, a company
00:01:50.640 who needs help in getting $10 million of
00:01:53.280 investment, would they be happy to pay
00:01:55.040 5%.
00:01:56.960 Yeah,
00:01:57.280 you guys can yell it out. Yes or no?
00:01:58.719 Some people are not sure. You're not
00:02:00.560 sure. Why?
00:02:02.799 I know. Just not my world.
00:02:04.640 Not your world. Let me ask you a
00:02:06.320 question.
00:02:07.840 I could help you get $10 million to buy
00:02:10.160 more cars.
00:02:12.000 See,
00:02:13.599 no. I mean, like, and I charge you 5%.
00:02:15.599 You would do that day deal every day of
00:02:17.360 the week, would you not? Oh yeah,
00:02:19.360 it's such a small percentage. So, if you
00:02:22.160 want to learn how to make more money and
00:02:23.920 get bigger clients, what do you need to
00:02:25.280 do?
00:02:26.560 What do you need to do?
00:02:28.560 Make that money. Uh Kevin Dailyaly says,
00:02:32.239 "What you need to do is you need to sell
00:02:33.840 money. You guys are selling the wrong
00:02:35.760 thing. You need to sell money. You're
00:02:39.120 selling services. You're selling time.
00:02:44.000 So, every time you can dollarize the
00:02:46.319 value of what it is that you do to put
00:02:48.319 it in real terms, it's an easy sale.
00:02:51.360 Sorry to interrupt. I want to let you
00:02:52.959 know that I'm starting this community
00:02:54.879 where we're going to help people just
00:02:56.000 like you, experts, authors, and coaches
00:02:58.000 to develop your personal brand. It's
00:03:00.080 called Content Lab. So, for more
00:03:01.920 information on that, just check out the
00:03:03.040 links in the description. Now, back to
00:03:04.480 our show.
00:03:05.000 No text
00:03:05.599 If you can measure it and it matters to
00:03:10.879 the client,
00:03:13.200 It's an easy sell. It's just a matter of
00:03:15.120 asking you the right questions. So, how
00:03:17.280 do how do we do this? How do we find
00:03:18.959 someone who wants this and can afford
00:03:20.959 this? So, there is a direct correlation
00:03:24.640 to size of problem
00:03:27.120 in the client's mind, not yours. Okay.
00:03:29.280 Size of problem to what? Size of
00:03:33.200 Yes.
00:03:33.920 budget.
00:03:35.840 That makes a lot of sense, right? It's
00:03:37.200 just pretty straightforward. And we
00:03:38.720 we're taught in school to be problem
00:03:40.239 solvers. We need to be problem seekers.
00:03:42.239 We need to find a problem before we
00:03:45.040 solve it. And you have to decouple your
00:03:48.720 knowledge and your desire to solve a
00:03:50.640 specific problem so you can find the
00:03:52.000 right problem. Let me say it in a
00:03:53.360 different way. Like if I make logos and
00:03:54.720 all I do is look for logo problems, I'm
00:03:56.080 already in trouble. I'm looking for a
00:03:58.159 person who has a business problem that
00:03:59.680 sometimes the logo is the answer.
00:04:02.319 There's a there's a big shift there.
00:04:03.760 Okay? Because you know like there's an
00:04:05.040 expression if the only tool you have is
00:04:07.200 a hammer all the problems look like
00:04:08.959 nails.
00:04:10.000 No text
00:04:10.879 That's the problem. Okay. We need to
00:04:13.120 find someone out there who has a burning
00:04:16.959 urgent desire to solve a problem that
00:04:19.440 they feel they've felt massive pain
00:04:21.519 around.
00:04:23.040 Anytime you can't sell something and
00:04:24.400 it's not worth a lot, it's because they
00:04:25.520 don't feel the pain. So, there's another
00:04:27.280 clue for you, which is when you talk to
00:04:29.040 the client, what should you do? You
00:04:30.880 should help them to find the pain. And
00:04:33.440 it's in the book Socratic Selling. Okay.
00:04:36.080 So I I'll write up here maybe here
00:04:38.240 motivation.
00:04:40.160 We're motivated
00:04:43.040 by um degree of pain felt
00:04:51.600 and how clear the outcome is.
00:04:57.440 Now, often times we try to sell the
00:04:59.360 clear outcome, but more often than not,
00:05:01.360 if we just help them to understand the
00:05:03.199 degree of pain that they're feeling, the
00:05:05.840 combination of two are very powerful to
00:05:07.600 motivate people to take action.
00:05:11.120 Some of you might say, I want to go to
00:05:12.960 gym. I want to go on a diet. The problem
00:05:14.880 is you don't feel the pain enough.
00:05:17.360 So, if I'm selling you gym memberships
00:05:19.280 or meal plans, I need to help you
00:05:20.960 understand the cost of not taking action
00:05:24.880 so that you can really feel this pain.
00:05:26.639 Cost of inaction.
00:05:29.440 So, one thing that you should do when
00:05:30.000 No text
00:05:30.960 you're talking to your clients is you
00:05:32.320 should ask them this one question. Why
00:05:34.800 not do nothing?
00:05:36.880 That'll help them to tell you how much
00:05:39.280 pain they're having around not taking
00:05:41.440 action. So, you guys know who Jonathan
00:05:43.440 Stark is?
00:05:44.880 Jonathan Stark is like
00:05:46.960 Why not doing nothing? Just wait. And
00:05:49.840 then the client will tell you, "Well, we
00:05:51.680 can't wait. We have a real problem. We
00:05:54.400 need this fixed now." So, we're looking
00:05:55.000 No text
00:05:56.800 for the wrong problem. We're serving the
00:05:58.639 wrong client. And when we find the wrong
00:06:00.479 client and selling the wrong service, we
00:06:02.560 say, "We'll just do it for less." Do you
00:06:04.080 see the problem? If you've enjoyed this
00:06:05.919 video, I wanted to remind you about
00:06:07.919 Content Lab, something that I've
00:06:09.520 launched and it's designed to help
00:06:11.840 coaches, content creators, and authors
00:06:13.919 just like you create content that
00:06:16.160 consistently cuts through the clutter.
